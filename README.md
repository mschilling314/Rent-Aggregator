# Rent Aggregator
Basic idea is to create a database that stores rental data, two tables per building with one table having columns of [unit #, floor plan name, beds, baths] and the other columns of [unit #, date, price].

The ultimate goal would be to create a tool that enables potential tenants to see historical rent prices for given units/properties, perhaps also turnover rates (potentially indicating property quality), etc. This would hopefully empower renters to use market forces to fight back against tyrannical landlords that just keep raising rent.
